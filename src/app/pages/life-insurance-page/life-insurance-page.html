                    Why Do You Need Life Insurance?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Life insurance serves many important purposes beyond just providing a death benefit. Here are some of the key reasons why life insurance is an essential part of your financial plan:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Young Families:</strong> Fund your children's education and provide for living expenses if something happens to you.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Income Replacement:</strong> Continue your family's finances and maintain their standard of living after the loss of a breadwinner.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Debt Protection:</strong> Cover mortgages, car loans, and other outstanding debts so your family isn't burdened.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Estate Planning:</strong> Manage final expenses and preserve assets for the next generation.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Charitable Giving:</strong> Make meaningful donations to causes you care about through policy death benefits.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Business Continuity:</strong> Use as an employee retention tool or fund buy/sell agreements for business owners.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Retirement Income:</strong> Use tax-deferred cash value as supplemental retirement funds.
                    </li>
                </ul>
