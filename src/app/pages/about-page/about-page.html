                <h2>History of the PFSA</h2>
                <p class="some-bold">Chartered on August 1, 1880, the Portuguese Society of America (PFSA) is the result of the Merger of four great societies as of January 1, 2010:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Portuguese Benevolent Society of California (founded in 1880)</li>
                    <li>Portuguese Fraternal Society of Rhode Island (founded in 1906)</li>
                    <li>Portuguese Mutual Benefit Society of Massachusetts (founded in 1911)</li>
                    <li>Portuguese American Fraternal Society of New Jersey (founded in 1920)</li>
                </ul>
                <p> The merger resulted in the PFSA now having the largest membership and the financially strongest Portuguese Fraternal Benefit Society in the Nation. The PFSA Home Office is located in Modesto, CA and the Society is licensed to transact business in California, Nevada and Rhode Island and has 67 fraternal councils (local subordinate chapters). We are proud of the dreams and vision of our forefathers and continue to honor their vision by succeeding and meeting the challenges of the XXI century with dignity and pride.</p>
