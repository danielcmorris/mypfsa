                    <p class="some-bold">Since the merger of four Portuguese Fraternal Societies in January 2010, PFSA has expanded its community engagement through member volunteer hours and financial contributions.</p>
                    <p>PFSA works with communities to support events, fundraisers, and local festivals. Our members donate their time and resources to various organizations, raising monetary donations for scholarship funds and supporting those in need.</p>
